    <h2>Summer</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
            The warmth on my skin,<br />
            The heat on my face,<br />
            Humidity in the air,<br />
            The sweat after a race.
        </p>
        <p>
            Longer days with fun and joy,<br />
            Is what summer brings.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sky in a brilliant shade of blue,<br />
            And so many more things.
        </p>
        <p>
            The cold, tingling feeling of the pool,<br />
            As our skin gives a sigh of relief.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our minds thinking of the lazy days,<br />
            When nobody is in grief.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sun shines merrily above the horizon,<br />
            Sharing its heat and light.
        </p>
        <p>
            A smile on everybody’s face,<br />

            As our hearts are filled with delight!
        </p>
        <h2>Never Give Up</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
            If I made a mistake,<br />
            then I would have to retake,<br />
            and do it once again,<br />
            even feel the pain.
        </p>
        <p>
            But there also lays a prize,<br />
            and that made me realise that,<br />
            even if I was to fail,<br />
            it would be a learning trail.
        </p>
        <p>
            If I hope for medals and a cup,<br />
            I can’t just rely on luck,<br />
            I must do hard work,<br />
            to show the world my worth.
        </p>
        <p>That’s the essence of never giving up!</p>
        <h2>Friendship</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
            Either winter or monsoon,<br />
            spring or summer,<br />
            this unsinkable ship,<br />
            floats forever.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is my only lifeboat,<br />
            on which I can survive.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is warmer than anything else,<br />
            and has always helped me to revive.
        </p>

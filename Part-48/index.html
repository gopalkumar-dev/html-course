            <h2>What is HTML ?</h2>
            <p>
                Ans. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It's a markup
                language that's used to create the structure and content of web
                pages. HTML uses tags to annotate text, images, and other
                content so that it can be displayed in a web browser.

            <h2 id="about-css" class="questions">What is CSS ?</h2>
            <p>
                Ans. CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and
                presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.This
                separation can improve content accessibility, since the content
                can be written without concern for its presentation; provide
                more flexibility and control in the specification of
                presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share
                formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css
                file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural
                content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the
                page load speed between the pages that share the file and its
                formatting.

            <h2 id="about-php" class="questions">What is PHP ?</h2>
            <p>
                Ans. PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a scripting language used
                to create dynamic web pages. It's a server-side language, which
                means that the server executes the PHP code and then sends the
                resulting HTML to the client.
